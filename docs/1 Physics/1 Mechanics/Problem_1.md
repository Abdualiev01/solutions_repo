# Problem 1 - Description of Motion

Motion describes the change in position of an object over time. It is categorized using several measurable quantities such as displacement, velocity, acceleration, and time. Below is a detailed explanation with formulas and descriptions.

---

## 1. Displacement (\(\vec{s}\))

Displacement is the shortest distance between the initial and final positions of an object, along with the direction.

### Formula:
\[
\vec{s} = \vec{x}_f - \vec{x}_i
\]

Where:  
- \(\vec{s}\): Displacement (a vector quantity with magnitude and direction)  
- \(\vec{x}_f\): Final position (vector)  
- \(\vec{x}_i\): Initial position (vector)  

### Explanation:
This formula calculates the displacement, which shows how far an object has moved and in what direction. For example, if an object starts at \(x = 0\) and moves to \(x = 10 \, \text{m}\), the displacement is \(10 \, \text{m}\) forward.

### Graph:
In a position-time graph, displacement can be visualized as the vertical difference between two points on the curve.

---

## 2. Velocity (\(v\))

Velocity is the rate of change of displacement with respect to time. It describes how fast an object is moving and in which direction.

### Formula:
\[
v = \frac{\Delta \vec{s}}{\Delta t}
\]

Where:  
- \(v\): Velocity (a vector quantity)  
- \(\Delta \vec{s}\): Displacement (change in position)  
- \(\Delta t\): Change in time  

### Explanation:
Velocity measures how quickly displacement changes over time. It is different from speed, as it includes direction. For example, a car moving at \(60 \, \text{km/h}\) east has a velocity of \(60 \, \text{km/h}\) east.

### Graph:
In a displacement-time graph, velocity is represented by the slope of the curve. A steeper slope indicates a higher velocity.

---

## 3. Acceleration (\(a\))

Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity with respect to time. It describes how quickly an object speeds up or slows down.

### Formula:
\[
a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}
\]

Where:  
- \(a\): Acceleration (a vector quantity)  
- \(\Delta v\): Change in velocity  
- \(\Delta t\): Change in time  

### Explanation:
Acceleration quantifies how fast the velocity of an object changes. A positive acceleration indicates speeding up, while a negative acceleration (also called deceleration) indicates slowing down. For example, a car increasing its velocity from \(0 \, \text{m/s}\) to \(20 \, \text{m/s}\) in \(5 \, \text{seconds}\) has an acceleration of \(4 \, \text{m/s}^2\).

### Graph:
In a velocity-time graph, acceleration is represented by the slope. A constant slope indicates constant acceleration, while a curved slope indicates changing acceleration.

---

## 4. Equations of Motion (For Constant Acceleration)

The equations of motion are used to calculate displacement, velocity, and time when acceleration is constant.

### Equations:
1. \(v = u + at\)  
- Final velocity (\(v\)) is equal to initial velocity (\(u\)) plus acceleration (\(a\)) multiplied by time (\(t\)).

2. \(s = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2\)  
- Displacement (\(s\)) is calculated using initial velocity (\(u\)), time (\(t\)), and acceleration (\(a\)).

3. \(v^2 = u^2 + 2as\)  
- Relates the final velocity (\(v\)) to the initial velocity (\(u\)), acceleration (\(a\)), and displacement (\(s\)).

### Explanation:
These equations are used to predict the motion of objects under constant acceleration. For example:
- A ball dropped from rest can use these equations to calculate its velocity or displacement at any point during its fall.

### Graphs:
Each equation corresponds to a specific type of graph:
- \(v = u + at\): Velocity-time graph (straight line).  
- \(s = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2\): Displacement-time graph (parabolic curve).  
- \(v^2 = u^2 + 2as\): Velocity-displacement graph (non-linear curve).
