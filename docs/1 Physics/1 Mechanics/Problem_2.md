# Problem 2

# Description of Motion

Motion is the change in position of an object with respect to time. It is described using concepts such as displacement, velocity, acceleration, and time.

## 1. Displacement ($\vec{s}$)
Displacement is the shortest distance between the initial and final positions of an object, along with direction.

### Formula:
\[
\vec{s} = \vec{x}_f - \vec{x}_i
\]
Where:
- $\vec{s}$ = displacement
- $\vec{x}_f$ = final position
- $\vec{x}_i$ = initial position

### Graph:
In a position-time graph, the slope represents the velocity. Displacement can be visualized as the difference in position values at two time intervals.

## 2. Velocity ($\vec{v}$)
Velocity is the rate of change of displacement with respect to time.

### Formula:
\[
\vec{v} = \frac{\vec{s}}{t}
\]
Where:
- $\vec{v}$ = velocity
- $\vec{s}$ = displacement
- $t$ = time

**For instantaneous velocity:**
\[
\vec{v} = \frac{d\vec{x}}{dt}
\]

### Graph:
In a position-time graph, the slope of the tangent at any point represents the instantaneous velocity.

## 3. Acceleration ($\vec{a}$)
Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity with respect to time.

### Formula:
\[
\vec{a} = \frac{\Delta\vec{v}}{t}
\]
Where:
- $\vec{a}$ = acceleration
- $\Delta\vec{v}$ = change in velocity ($\vec{v}_f - \vec{v}_i$)
- $t$ = time

**For instantaneous acceleration:**
\[
\vec{a} = \frac{d\vec{v}}{dt}
\]

### Graph:
In a velocity-time graph, the slope represents acceleration. The area under the curve represents the change in velocity.

## 4. Equations of Motion (For Uniform Acceleration)

### 1st Equation:
\[
\vec{v} = \vec{u} + \vec{a}t
\]
Where:
- $\vec{v}$ = final velocity
- $\vec{u}$ = initial velocity
- $\vec{a}$ = acceleration
- $t$ = time

### 2nd Equation:
\[
\vec{s} = \vec{u}t + \frac{1}{2}\vec{a}t^2
\]
Where:
- $\vec{s}$ = displacement

### 3rd Equation:
\[
\vec{v}^2 = \vec{u}^2 + 2\vec{a}\vec{s}
\]

### Graph:
In a velocity-time graph:
- The slope indicates acceleration.
- The area under the curve equals displacement.

## 5. Circular Motion
In circular motion, the object moves along a circular path.

### Angular Displacement ($\theta$):
\[
\theta = \frac{s}{r}
\]
Where:
- $s$ = arc length
- $r$ = radius

### Angular Velocity ($\omega$):
\[
\omega = \frac{d\theta}{dt}
\]

### Angular Acceleration ($\alpha$):
\[
\alpha = \frac{d\omega}{dt}
\]

### Centripetal Acceleration ($a_c$):
\[
\vec{a}_c = \frac{\vec{v}^2}{r}
\]
Where:
- $\vec{v}$ = tangential velocity
- $r$ = radius of the circular path

### Graph:
In circular motion, angular velocity and acceleration are often plotted as functions of time to describe periodicity.

## Graphical Summary:
1. **Position-Time Graph:** Slope represents velocity.
2. **Velocity-Time Graph:** Slope represents acceleration; area under the curve represents displacement.
3. **Acceleration-Time Graph:** Area under the curve represents change in velocity.
