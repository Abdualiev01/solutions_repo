# Problem 2 -  Velocity (\(v\))

Velocity describes the rate of change of displacement with respect to time. It is a vector quantity, meaning it has both magnitude and direction.

---

## 1. Average Velocity

### Formula:
\[
v_{avg} = \frac{\Delta \vec{s}}{\Delta t}
\]

Where:  
- \(v_{avg}\): Average velocity (vector quantity)  
- \(\Delta \vec{s}\): Displacement (final position minus initial position)  
- \(\Delta t\): Time interval  

### Explanation:
Average velocity measures how quickly an object changes its position over a specific time interval. For example, if an object moves \(20 \, \text{m}\) east in \(4 \, \text{s}\), the average velocity is \(5 \, \text{m/s}\) east.

---

## 2. Instantaneous Velocity

### Formula:
\[
v = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta \vec{s}}{\Delta t} = \frac{d\vec{s}}{dt}
\]

Where:  
- \(v\): Instantaneous velocity (vector quantity)  
- \(d\vec{s}\): Infinitesimally small displacement  
- \(dt\): Infinitesimally small time interval  

### Explanation:
Instantaneous velocity is the velocity of an object at a particular moment in time. It is obtained by taking the derivative of displacement (\(\vec{s}\)) with respect to time (\(t\)). For example, in non-uniform motion, the instantaneous velocity at a given time tells you how fast and in which direction the object is moving at that specific moment.

## 3. Relation Between Velocity and Speed

- **Velocity** is a vector quantity, considering direction (e.g., \(5 \, \text{m/s}\) east).  
- **Speed** is a scalar quantity, considering only magnitude (e.g., \(5 \, \text{m/s}\)).

### Key Formula for Magnitude:
\[
|\vec{v}| = \text{Speed}
\]

---

## 4. Velocity-Time Graph

### Description:
- A **straight line** on the graph indicates constant velocity.
- A **sloping line** indicates acceleration or deceleration.
- The **area under the curve** represents displacement.

---

## 5. Equations of Velocity (For Uniform Acceleration)

When acceleration is constant, velocity is calculated using the following equations of motion:

### Formula 1: Final Velocity
\[
v = u + at
\]

Where:  
- \(v\): Final velocity  
- \(u\): Initial velocity  
- \(a\): Acceleration  
- \(t\): Time  

### Formula 2: Velocity-Displacement Relation
\[
v^2 = u^2 + 2as
\]

Where:  
- \(v\): Final velocity  
- \(u\): Initial velocity  
- \(a\): Acceleration  
- \(s\): Displacement  

### Explanation:
- The first equation calculates the final velocity after a time \(t\), given the initial velocity and constant acceleration.  
- The second equation relates velocity to displacement when time is not given.

---

## 6. Summary of Key Points

- Velocity is the rate of change of displacement with respect to time.  
- It is a vector quantity, meaning it has both magnitude and direction.  
- The slope of a displacement-time graph represents velocity.  
- The area under a velocity-time graph gives displacement.

---

## Graphical Representation

1. **Displacement-Time Graph**:  
   - The slope of the curve at any point gives the instantaneous velocity.

2. **Velocity-Time Graph**:  
   - A horizontal line indicates constant velocity.  
   - A sloped line indicates acceleration or deceleration.  
   - The area under the curve gives the total displacement.

### Example Problem (Using a Velocity-Time Graph)

#### Question:
A car starts from rest and accelerates uniformly at \(2 \, \text{m/s}^2\) for \(5 \, \text{seconds}\). Find its final velocity and the displacement during this time.

#### Solution:
1. Final velocity:  
   Using \(v = u + at\),  
   \[
   v = 0 + (2)(5) = 10 \, \text{m/s}.
   \]

2. Displacement:  
   Using \(s = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2\),  
   \[
   s = 0(5) + \frac{1}{2}(2)(5^2) = 25 \, \text{m}.
   \]

The car reaches a velocity of \(10 \, \text{m/s}\) and covers \(25 \, \text{m}\) during the time.
