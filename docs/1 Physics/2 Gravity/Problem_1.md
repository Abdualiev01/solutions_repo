# Problem 1 - Gravitational Force (\(F\))

Gravitational force is the attractive force between two masses due to their mass and the distance between them. It is described by Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation.

---

## Formula:
\[
F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}
\]

Where:  
- \(F\): Gravitational force (in Newtons, \(N\))  
- \(G\): Gravitational constant \((6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{NÂ·m}^2/\text{kg}^2)\)  
- \(m_1\): Mass of the first object (in kilograms)  
- \(m_2\): Mass of the second object (in kilograms)  
- \(r\): Distance between the centers of the two masses (in meters)  

---

## Explanation:
Gravitational force acts between any two objects with mass, regardless of their size. The force is directly proportional to the product of the masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. For example:
- The gravitational pull between the Earth and Moon keeps the Moon in orbit around Earth.  
- If the distance between two objects doubles, the gravitational force becomes one-fourth.

## Graph:
### Gravitational Force vs. Distance (\(F\) vs. \(r\)):
- The graph is a hyperbolic curve, showing that the force decreases rapidly as the distance increases.

### Gravitational Force vs. Mass (\(F\) vs. \(m\)):
- A straight line indicating that force increases proportionally with mass.

## Example Problem:
#### Question:
Find the gravitational force between two objects with masses \(5 \, \text{kg}\) and \(10 \, \text{kg}\) separated by a distance of \(2 \, \text{m}\).

#### Solution:
Using the formula:  
\(
F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}
\)  
Substitute the values:  
\(
F = (6.674 \times 10^{-11}) \frac{(5)(10)}{2^2}
\)
\(
F = 8.34 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{N}.
\)

The gravitational force between the objects is \(8.34 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{N}\).
