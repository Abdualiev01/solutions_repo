# Problem 2 - Acceleration Due to Gravity (\(g\))

The acceleration experienced by an object due to Earth's gravitational pull is known as acceleration due to gravity. It is approximately \(9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2\) near the Earth's surface.

---

## Formula:
\[
g = \frac{G M}{r^2}
\]

Where:  
- \(g\): Acceleration due to gravity (in \(\text{m/s}^2\))  
- \(G\): Gravitational constant \((6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{kg}^2)\)  
- \(M\): Mass of the celestial body (e.g., Earth)  
- \(r\): Radius of the celestial body (distance from the center to the surface)  

---

## Explanation:
The acceleration due to gravity depends on the mass of the celestial body and the distance from its center. For Earth:
- \(M = 5.972 \times 10^{24} \, \text{kg}\)  
- \(r = 6.371 \times 10^{6} \, \text{m}\)

Using these values, \(g \approx 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2\).

## Graph:
### Acceleration (\(g\)) vs. Distance from Earth’s Center (\(r\)):
- As the distance from the Earth's center increases, the acceleration due to gravity decreases, forming a hyperbolic curve.

## Example Problem:
#### Question:
What is the value of \(g\) at a height of \(500 \, \text{km}\) above Earth's surface?

#### Solution:
1. Total distance from the Earth's center:  
   \[
   r = 6.371 \times 10^6 + 500 \times 10^3 = 6.871 \times 10^6 \, \text{m}.
   \]

2. Substitute into the formula:  
   \[
   g = \frac{(6.674 \times 10^{-11})(5.972 \times 10^{24})}{(6.871 \times 10^6)^2}.
   \]  

3. Simplify:  
   \[
   g \approx 8.69 \, \text{m/s}^2.
   \]

At \(500 \, \text{km}\) above Earth, the acceleration due to gravity is approximately \(8.69 \, \text{m/s}^2\).
