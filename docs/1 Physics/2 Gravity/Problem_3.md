# Problem 3 - Escape Velocity (\(v_e\))

Escape velocity is the minimum speed an object must have to escape a planet’s gravitational pull without any further propulsion.

---

## Formula:

\[
v_e = \sqrt{\frac{2 G M}{r}}
\]

Where:  
- \(v_e\): Escape velocity (in \(\text{m/s}\))  
- \(G\): Gravitational constant \((6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{kg}^2)\)  
- \(M\): Mass of the celestial body (e.g., Earth)  
- \(r\): Radius of the celestial body  

---

## Explanation:
Escape velocity depends on the mass and radius of the celestial body. For Earth:
- \(M = 5.972 \times 10^{24} \, \text{kg}\)  
- \(r = 6.371 \times 10^6 \, \text{m}\)

Substituting these values, Earth’s escape velocity is approximately \(11.2 \, \text{km/s}\).

## Graph:
### Escape Velocity vs. Mass (\(v_e\) vs. \(M\)):

- The escape velocity increases as the mass of the celestial body increases. The graph of this relationship is a square root function.

## Example Problem:

#### Question:
Find the escape velocity for the Moon.  

Given:  
- Mass of the Moon: \(M = 7.35 \times 10^{22} \, \text{kg}\)  
- Radius of the Moon: \(r = 1.74 \times 10^6 \, \text{m}\)

#### Solution:

Using the formula:

\(
v_e = \sqrt{\frac{2 G M}{r}}
\)

Substitute the known values:

\(
v_e = \sqrt{\frac{2 (6.674 \times 10^{-11})(7.35 \times 10^{22})}{1.74 \times 10^6}}
\)

After calculating:

\(
v_e \approx 2.38 \, \text{km/s}
\)

The escape velocity for the Moon is approximately \(2.38 \, \text{km/s}\).
