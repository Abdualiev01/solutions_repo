# Projectile Motion: Quick Notes

### What is Projectile Motion?
Projectile motion is the motion of an object under the influence of gravity, following a curved path called a **parabola**. It occurs when an object is launched into the air with an initial velocity.

### Key Components
1. **Initial Velocity ($v_0$):** The speed and direction at which the object is launched.

   - Horizontal component: $v_x = v_0 \cos(\theta)$
   - Vertical component: $v_y = v_0 \sin(\theta)$

2. **Angle of Projection ($\theta$):** The angle at which the object is launched with respect to the horizontal.

3. **Acceleration ($a$):**

   - Horizontal: $a_x = 0$ (no acceleration in ideal conditions)
   - Vertical: $a_y = -g$ (gravity, approximately $9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2$ downward)

4. **Time of Flight ($T$):**

   - Total time the object stays in the air.
   - $T = \frac{2v_0 \sin(\theta)}{g}$

5. **Maximum Height ($H$):**

   - The highest point reached by the object.
   - $H = \frac{(v_0 \sin(\theta))^2}{2g}$

6. **Range ($R$):**

   - The horizontal distance covered by the object.
   - $R = \frac{v_0^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g}$

### Equations of Motion

- Horizontal motion:
  - $x = v_x t$
  - $v_x$ is constant.
- Vertical motion:
  - $y = v_y t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2$

---

### Characteristics

- The path is **symmetric** about the peak.
- At the peak:
  - Vertical velocity ($v_y$) is zero.
  - Horizontal velocity ($v_x$) remains constant.

---

### Assumptions

- Air resistance is negligible.
- Acceleration due to gravity is constant and acts only vertically.
