It is categorized using several measurable quantities such as displacement, velocity, acceleration, and time. Below is a detailed explanation with formulas and descriptions. 1. Displacement ( \\(\\vec{s}\\) ) Displacement is the shortest distance between the initial and final positions of an object, along with the direction. Formula: \\[ \\vec{s} = \\vec{x}_f - \\vec{x}_i \\] Where: - \\(\\vec{s}\\) : Displacement (a vector quantity with magnitude and direction) - \\(\\vec{x}_f\\) : Final position (vector) - \\(\\vec{x}_i\\) : Initial position (vector) Explanation: This formula calculates the displacement, which shows how far an object has moved and in what direction. For example, if an object starts at \\(x = 0\\) and moves to \\(x = 10 \\, \\text{m}\\) , the displacement is \\(10 \\, \\text{m}\\) forward. Graph: In a position-time graph, displacement can be visualized as the vertical difference between two points on the curve. 2. Velocity ( \\(v\\) ) Velocity is the rate of change of displacement with respect to time. It describes how fast an object is moving and in which direction. Formula: \\[ v = \\frac{\\Delta \\vec{s}}{\\Delta t} \\] Where: - \\(v\\) : Velocity (a vector quantity) - \\(\\Delta \\vec{s}\\) : Displacement (change in position) - \\(\\Delta t\\) : Change in time Explanation: Velocity measures how quickly displacement changes over time. It is different from speed, as it includes direction. For example, a car moving at \\(60 \\, \\text{km/h}\\) east has a velocity of \\(60 \\, \\text{km/h}\\) east. Graph: In a displacement-time graph, velocity is represented by the slope of the curve. A steeper slope indicates a higher velocity. 3. Acceleration ( \\(a\\) ) Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity with respect to time. It describes how quickly an object speeds up or slows down. Formula: \\[ a = \\frac{\\Delta v}{\\Delta t} \\] Where: - \\(a\\) : Acceleration (a vector quantity) - \\(\\Delta v\\) : Change in velocity - \\(\\Delta t\\) : Change in time Explanation: Acceleration quantifies how fast the velocity of an object changes. A positive acceleration indicates speeding up, while a negative acceleration (also called deceleration) indicates slowing down. For example, a car increasing its velocity from \\(0 \\, \\text{m/s}\\) to \\(20 \\, \\text{m/s}\\) in \\(5 \\, \\text{seconds}\\) has an acceleration of \\(4 \\, \\text{m/s}^2\\) . Graph: In a velocity-time graph, acceleration is represented by the slope. A constant slope indicates constant acceleration, while a curved slope indicates changing acceleration. 4. Equations of Motion (For Constant Acceleration) The equations of motion are used to calculate displacement, velocity, and time when acceleration is constant. Equations: \\(v = u + at\\) : Final velocity ( \\(v\\) ) is equal to initial velocity ( \\(u\\) ) plus acceleration ( \\(a\\) ) multiplied by time ( \\(t\\) ). \\(s = ut + \\frac{1}{2}at^2\\) Displacement ( \\(s\\) ) is calculated using initial velocity ( \\(u\\) ), time ( \\(t\\) ), and acceleration ( \\(a\\) ). \\(v^2 = u^2 + 2as\\) : Relates the final velocity ( \\(v\\) ) to the initial velocity ( \\(u\\) ), acceleration ( \\(a\\) ), and displacement ( \\(s\\) ). Explanation: These equations are used to predict the motion of objects under constant acceleration. For example: - A ball dropped from rest can use these equations to calculate its velocity or displacement at any point during its fall. Graphs: Each equation corresponds to a specific type of graph: - \\(v = u + at\\) : Velocity-time graph (straight line). - \\(s = ut + \\frac{1}{2}at^2\\) : Displacement-time graph (parabolic curve). - \\(v^2 = u^2 + 2as\\) : Velocity-displacement graph (non-linear curve). 5.
