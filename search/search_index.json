It is analyzed in two components: horizontal and vertical motion, which are independent of each other. Here\u2019s a detailed breakdown with formulas: Key Variables \\( u \\) : Initial velocity \\( \\theta \\) : Angle of projection \\( g \\) : Acceleration due to gravity ( \\( 9.8 \\, \\text{m/s}^2 \\) ) \\( t \\) : Time of flight \\( R \\) : Range (horizontal distance covered) \\( h_{\\text{max}} \\) : Maximum height \\( x \\) : Horizontal displacement \\( y \\) : Vertical displacement Horizontal Motion The horizontal motion is uniform because there is no horizontal acceleration (ignoring air resistance). - Horizontal velocity: [ u_x = u \\cos \\theta ] Horizontal displacement: [ x = u_x t = u \\cos \\theta \\cdot t ] Vertical Motion The vertical motion is uniformly accelerated due to gravity. - Vertical velocity: [ u_y = u \\sin \\theta ] At any time \\( t \\) , the vertical velocity is: [ v_y = u_y - g t = u \\sin \\theta - g t ] - Vertical displacement: [ y = u_y t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 = u \\sin \\theta \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 ] Time of Flight The total time the projectile stays in the air: [ t_{\\text{flight}} = \\frac{2 u \\sin \\theta}{g} ] Range ( \\( R \\) ) The horizontal distance covered during the flight: [ R = \\frac{u^2 \\sin 2\\theta}{g} ] Maximum Height ( \\( h_{\\text{max}} \\) ) The highest point reached by the projectile: [ h_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{u^2 \\sin^2 \\theta}{2g} ] Trajectory Equation Combining \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) : [ y = x \\tan \\theta - \\frac{g x^2}{2 u^2 \\cos^2 \\theta} ] This equation represents the parabolic path of the projectile. By applying these formulas, you can analyze and predict various aspects of projectile motion based on initial conditions like velocity and angle of projection.","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#problem-1","text":"Projectile motion involves the motion of an object launched into the air under the influence of gravity, following a parabolic trajectory.
