It is described using concepts such as displacement, velocity, acceleration, and time. 1. Displacement ( \\(\\vec{s}\\) ) Displacement is the shortest distance between the initial and final positions of an object, along with direction. Formula: [ \\vec{s} = \\vec{x}_f - \\vec{x}_i ] Where: - \\(\\vec{s}\\) = displacement - \\(\\vec{x}_f\\) = final position - \\(\\vec{x}_i\\) = initial position Graph: In a position-time graph, the slope represents the velocity. Displacement can be visualized as the difference in position values at two time intervals. 2. Velocity ( \\(\\vec{v}\\) ) Velocity is the rate of change of displacement with respect to time. Formula: [ \\vec{v} = \\frac{\\vec{s}}{t} ] Where: - \\(\\vec{v}\\) = velocity - \\(\\vec{s}\\) = displacement - \\(t\\) = time For instantaneous velocity: [ \\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{x}}{dt} ] Graph: In a position-time graph, the slope of the tangent at any point represents the instantaneous velocity. 3. Acceleration ( \\(\\vec{a}\\) ) Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity with respect to time. Formula: [ \\vec{a} = \\frac{\\Delta\\vec{v}}{t} ] Where: - \\(\\vec{a}\\) = acceleration - \\(\\Delta\\vec{v}\\) = change in velocity ( \\(\\vec{v}_f - \\vec{v}_i\\) ) - \\(t\\) = time For instantaneous acceleration: [ \\vec{a} = \\frac{d\\vec{v}}{dt} ] Graph: In a velocity-time graph, the slope represents acceleration. The area under the curve represents the change in velocity. 4. Equations of Motion (For Uniform Acceleration) 1st Equation: [ \\vec{v} = \\vec{u} + \\vec{a}t ] Where: - \\(\\vec{v}\\) = final velocity - \\(\\vec{u}\\) = initial velocity - \\(\\vec{a}\\) = acceleration - \\(t\\) = time 2nd Equation: [ \\vec{s} = \\vec{u}t + \\frac{1}{2}\\vec{a}t^2 ] Where: - \\(\\vec{s}\\) = displacement 3rd Equation: \\[ \\vec{v}^2 = \\vec{u}^2 + 2\\vec{a}\\vec{s} \\] Graph: In a velocity-time graph: - The slope indicates acceleration. - The area under the curve equals displacement. 5. Circular Motion In circular motion, the object moves along a circular path. Angular Displacement ( \\(\\theta\\) ): [ \\theta = \\frac{s}{r} ] Where: - \\(s\\) = arc length - \\(r\\) = radius Angular Velocity ( \\(\\omega\\) ): \\[ \\omega = \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} \\] Angular Acceleration ( \\(\\alpha\\) ): \\[ \\alpha = \\frac{d\\omega}{dt} \\] Centripetal Acceleration ( \\(a_c\\) ): [ \\vec{a}_c = \\frac{\\vec{v}^2}{r} ] Where: - \\(\\vec{v}\\) = tangential velocity - \\(r\\) = radius of the circular path Graph: In circular motion, angular velocity and acceleration are often plotted as functions of time to describe periodicity. Graphical Summary: Position-Time Graph: Slope represents velocity. Velocity-Time Graph: Slope represents acceleration; area under the curve represents displacement. Acceleration-Time Graph: Area under the curve represents change in velocity.
